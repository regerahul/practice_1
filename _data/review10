The iPhone 6 is the pinnacle of mobile computing, a fast and beautifully engineered device that integrates smoothly with both Macs and iPads. I'm a Fanboy, yes, but I've tried Android phones. I've given the competition a fair shake. I went from an iPhone 4s to a Samsung Note 2 and then to a Moto X and I was so aggravated by the constant trade-offs that I finally just gave up and went back to Apple. Android devices stuttered when scrolling, didn't create hotspots when I needed them, and inconsistently connected to Bluetooth. Cameras were slow and awkward and you were lucky to get more than one or two OS updates (my Note 2 on T-Mobile never got 4.4). These are things I take for granted on an iPhone.

So why the 1 star? Because Apple never ceases to disgust me with their power adapters. Great phone, horrible horrible cables. No other tablet or phone manufacturer uses a proprietary format and if one or two does, then they don't deliberately sabotage 3rd party adapters to force you into overpriced Apple ones. I needed a 30pin to Lightning adapter to control my iPhone from my car. $40 for the official Apple model. That's like buying HDMI cables at Best Buy. I'm pretty sure there's a chapter in Business 101 that says if you're getting compared to Best Buy, then you're doing something wrong.

Last week I had to drive my wife's Buick. The 3rd party cables that worked in my car could not charge in hers. These same cables worked fine later when connected to my MacBook. So Apple is cool when you're using another manufacturer's cable connected to your Apple computer, but not the USB port in a car? That's just mean.

The worst part is that Apple's got me bent over a barrel. I love their phones. Android phones may be bigger, faster, and have more features, but none provide the consistently I need from my phone. So I'm trapped with a drawer full of Lightning cables that may or may not work when I need them.
