I went from the iphone5 to the iphone6 and the only difference I noticed is the physical size of the phone being bigger (obviously) and the feature that allows the thumbprint to unlock phone without typing in the security code. Other than that there are no differences. I was really hoping the iPhone6 would be faster but that definitely did not happen. I was so disappointed that I returned the iphone6 and went back to iphone5. Maybe the next one will be better.
