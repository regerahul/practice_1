To start, this phone is so overpriced. Apple has gotten to a point where they've drawn in all their customers and Apple knows they can't escape. Because of this, customers will pay basically anything short of their first born to buy this phone. The price can't even be explained by its features. As an example, Galaxy S5 has just about the same amount of features plus more (waterproof, auto-encryption, multiple users using Android L.)

Also, the durability is also garbage. How often do you see an iPhone with a cracked screen? Almost every day! Galaxy products, to use the same example as before, are a lot more tough and durable. I've dropped my phone multiple times, yes I'm careless, and it doesn't have a scratch on it. This way, I don't have to waste MORE money on buying a case just to protect the said "smart glass."

Overall, it's a high price for a cheap phone.
