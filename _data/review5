I have always been an avid iPhone user, ever since the 3 was released. This one just takes the cake, by far surpassing all it's predecessors. I picked this phone up at target and from the moment I got it out of the box I was blown away. The screen size, I feel, fully unlocks the potential of iOS in general. It's really sharp and easy to see. The camera is amazing too, my favorite part is the built in slow-motion feature, which works flawlessly. It takes beautiful photos and videos. This phone is also exceptionally faster than all its predecessors, apps launching in record time. It's super sleek and wonderful and I couldn't be happier.

The only problem I can really find is that sometimes when you have portrait lock on and open the camera, the gyro goes completely wonky and thinks that the iPhone is upside down, therefore resulting in upside down photos. I hope this will be fixed when I update my software today, but if not I just edit the image and flip it around.
