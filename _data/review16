Previously I owned an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2. These were my first ventures into the apple world. They were both marvels of design and engineering. So much so I was considering a switch to a Mac for my computing needs. I skipped the iPhone 5 but thought it about time to upgrade when 6 became avaialable. Having it now for 2 months I would rename it iCrap6. Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratches if you stare at it). This convinced me not to upgrade the iPad so I installed iOS 8. Another mistake. My old iPad has never worked so poorly. As for moving to a Mac, the idea has completely disappeared from my head. It seems the philosophy of Apple has also disappeared from the corporate psyche.
