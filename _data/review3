I've been an iPhone guy since the beginning, but I'm pretty salty after my experience with the 6. In fact, I will probably never buy another iPhone. I dropped my 6 at most two feet after about three weeks of ownership. It landed on the back of the phone, yet somehow the glass shattered. I've had two friends with the same issue. Mind you, I should've bought a case. But what's the point of a "sleek" and "thin" phone if you have to put a bulky case on it to protect it? I've dropped my other iPhones from higher distances on harder surfaces with almost no damage (and no damage to the screen at all).

Then, I bought a kit to fix it. I'm not much of a techy, but I broke down the phone to the last step (after hours of work...again because I'm slow) only to realize there is not way to fix the screen. The glass and touch screen panel are fused together. You cannot fix your phone without sending it back to Apple for a couple hundred bucks!!! Meanwhile, Droids are very easy to fix. I've seen it done a few times. It's as if Android cares about things like easy repairs whereas Apple wants you to fork out more money. I find this to go against everything the company used to stand for or at least what we were told Apple stands for - caring about the end user/customer.

Anyhow, the phone is probably fine if you get a case right away. If not, be very careful with it because the slightest knock off a table will likely crack the glass.

Oh and Apple won't care about your issue. They've cornered the market in the US, so an unhappy customer here and there doesn't matter. Not when they can keep running those same commercials over and over again about how great it is.
