I purchased this phone since my employer wants their employees using an Apple product for their apps. I've used Android and Windows phones as well. The pros are good build quality, nice display, good sound and call quality, decent battery life. But, IMO, you can get all this with an Android device at a fraction of the cost. Die hard Apple fans will be happy regardless. Windows phones are by far the best bang for the buck, but apps are still limited. Several big annoyances for me with the Apple phone. You're stuck having to install and use iTunes to manage the phone such as to add music or ringtones. Even with the majority of 3rd party programs, iTunes still needs to be installed for them to work. If there is any bug or problem with iTunes, then you can have problems. I could not get music on my PC to sync with the phone whether using iTunes or a 3rd party program. The transfer would just fail without any warning. After more than 20 minutes on phone with Apple tech, who couldn't figure the problem out, I was disconnected and never got a call back. Ended up trouble shooting the problem myself and discovered the trouble was from the iTunes installation being on a "locked drive". Google "repair security permissions for itunes for windows" for the solution. If you don't have unlimited data, and want to turn cellular data off, you may find your bluetooth voice commands won't work. You'll need to turn Siri off for them to work, otherwise, you'll have to listen to Siri telling you to connect to the internet. If you're a fan of Apple and don't care about price, or there is a business need to use Apple, buy this phone. If you want value for your money, have the freedom of choice, and to optimize for your personal use, then you have many more and better options elsewhere. A final word, imo, if you want the best price on an unlocked gsm iphone 6, buy it direct from Apple. I can verify that the no contract T-mobile iphone 6 they sell will work just fine with an AT&T sim card.
